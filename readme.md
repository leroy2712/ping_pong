# Ping Pong IP3

Ping Pong is a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

  - Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
  - Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
  - Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"
  - 
 A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

I have written the code in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS and JQuery
